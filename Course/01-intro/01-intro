## ML Zoomcamp 2024: Introduction to Machine Learning - Part 1

The concept of Machine Learning (ML) is illustrated through an example of predicting car prices. Data, including features such as year and mileage, is used by the ML model to learn and identify patterns. The target variable, in this case, is the car's price.

New data, which lacks the target variable, is then provided to the model to predict the price.

In summary, ML involves extracting patterns from data, which is categorized into two types:
- **Features**: Information about the object.
- **Target**: The property to be predicted for unseen objects.

New feature values are inputted into the model, which generates predictions based on the patterns it has learned. This is an overview of what has been learned from the ML course by Alexey Grigorev ([ML Zoomcamp](http://mlzoomcamp.com)). All images in this post are sourced from the course material.

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning (ML) is explained as the process of training a model using features and target information to predict unknown object targets. In other words, ML is about extracting patterns from data, which includes features and targets.

To understand ML, it is important to differentiate between the following terms:
- **Features**: What is known about an object. In this example, it refers to the characteristics of a car. A feature represents an object's attribute in various forms, such as numbers, strings, or more complex formats (e.g., location information).
- **Target**: The aspect to be predicted. The term "label" is also used in some sources. During training, a labeled dataset is used since the target is known. For example, datasets of cars with known prices are used to predict prices for other cars with unknown values.
- **Model**: The result of the training process, which encompasses the patterns learned from the training data. This model is utilized later to make predictions about the target variable based on the features of an unknown object.

### Training and Using a Model

- **Train a Model**: The training process involves the extraction of patterns from the provided training data. In simpler terms, features are combined with the target, resulting in the creation of the model.

- **Use a Model**: Training alone does not make the model useful. The benefit is realized through its application. By applying the trained model to new data (without targets), predictions for the missing information (e.g., price) are obtained. Therefore, features are used during prediction, while the trained model is applied to generate predictions for the target variable.
