# Machine Learning Zoomcamp

This course is designed for understand the fundamentals of machine learning and learn how to use key ML frameworks and tools. The only prerequisite for the course is prior programming experience (at least one year) and familiarity with the command line.

The course is structured into two parts:

Part 1 focuses on machine learning algorithms implemented in Python, including Linear Regression, Classification, Decision Trees, Ensemble Learning, and Neural Networks. 

Part 2 is centered around deploying models using popular frameworks such as Flask, TensorFlow, and Kubernetes.

## Taking the course

### 2024 cohort

We start the course again in September 2024

* 16 September, 17:00 Berlin time
* [Sign up here](https://airtable.com/shryxwLd0COOEaqXo)
* Register at [DataTalks.Club](https://DataTalks.Club/slack.html) and join the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel 
* Join the [course telegram channel](https://t.me/mlzoomcamp)
* Subscribe to the [public google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/?cid=cGtjZ2tkbGc1OG9yb2lxa2Vwc2g4YXMzMmNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) (subscribing works from desktop only)
* [Tweet about it](https://ctt.ac/XZ6b9)
* If you have questions, check [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LpPanc33QJJ6BSsyxVg-pWNMplal84TdZtq10naIhD8/edit)
* All the materials specific to the 2024 will be in [the 2024 cohort folder](./cohorts/2024/) 


### Self-paced mode

You can take the course at your own pace. All the materials are freely available, and you can start learning at any time.

To take the best out of this course, we recommened this:

* Register at [DataTalks.Club](https://DataTalks.Club) and join the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel 
* For each module, watch the videos and work through the code
* If you have any questions, ask them in the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel in Slack
* Do homework. There are solutions, but we advise to first attempt the homework yourself, and after that check the solutions
* Do at least one project. Two is better. Only this way you can make sure you're really learning. If you need feedback, use the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel

Of course, you can take each module independently.

### Prerequisites

* Prior programming experience (at least 1+ year)
* Being comfortable with command line 
* No prior exposure to machine learning is required

Nice to have but not mandatory

* Python (but you can learn it during the course)
* Prior exposure to linear algebra will be helpful (e.g. you studied it in college but forgot)

## Asking questions

The best way to get support is to use [DataTalks.Club's Slack](https://datatalks.club/slack.html). Join the [`#course-ml-zoomcamp`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C0288NJ5XSA) channel.

To make discussions in Slack more organized:

* Follow [these recommendations](asking-questions.md) when asking for help
* Read the [DataTalks.Club community guidelines](https://datatalks.club/slack/guidelines.html)
