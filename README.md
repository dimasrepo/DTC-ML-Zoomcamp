# Machine Learning Zoomcamp

This course is designed for understand the fundamentals of machine learning and learn how to use key ML frameworks and tools. The only prerequisite for the course is prior programming experience (at least one year) and familiarity with the command line.

The course is structured into two parts:

</p>

## Part 1

Focuses on machine learning algorithms implemented in Python, including Linear Regression, Classification, Decision Trees, Ensemble Learning, and Neural Networks. 

- **Linear Regression**: Focuses on feature engineering, handling categorical variables, and the critical role of regularization.
- **Classification**: Emphasizes logistic regression and analyzing feature importance.
- **Decision Trees and Ensemble Learning**: Highlights the gradient boosting technique and XGBoost, a widely-used ensemble learning algorithm.
- **Neural Networks and Deep Learning**: Covers Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning strategies to solve complex problems using deep learning.
- **Python and Jupyter Notebooks**: Enhances coding efficiency and productivity.
- **NumPy and Pandas**: Explores linear algebra concepts, such as matrices, along with data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Involves creating visualizations and graphical representations of data.
- **Scikit-Learn**: Applies various machine learning algorithms to real-world datasets.
- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Introduces popular frameworks for building neural networks and deep learning models.

</p>


## Part 2 

Centered around deploying models using popular frameworks such as Flask, TensorFlow, and Kubernetes.

- **Flask, Pipenv, and Docker**: Facilitates deploying machine learning models, allowing the transition from notebooks to production services and applications.
- **AWS Lambda and TensorFlow Lite**: Focuses on serverless deep learning and how to operate efficiently within this framework.
- **Kubernetes and TensorFlow Serving**: Automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
- **KServe (optional)**: Provides advanced knowledge for those looking to further enhance their model deployment capabilities.

## Taking the course

### 2024 cohort

We start the course again in September 2024

* 16 September, 17:00 Berlin time
* [Sign up here](https://airtable.com/shryxwLd0COOEaqXo)
* Register at [DataTalks.Club](https://DataTalks.Club/slack.html) and join the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel 
* Join the [course telegram channel](https://t.me/mlzoomcamp)
* Subscribe to the [public google calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/?cid=cGtjZ2tkbGc1OG9yb2lxa2Vwc2g4YXMzMmNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ) (subscribing works from desktop only)
* [Tweet about it](https://ctt.ac/XZ6b9)
* If you have questions, check [FAQ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LpPanc33QJJ6BSsyxVg-pWNMplal84TdZtq10naIhD8/edit)
* All the materials specific to the 2024 will be in [the 2024 cohort folder](./cohorts/2024/) 


### Self-paced mode

You can take the course at your own pace. All the materials are freely available, and you can start learning at any time.

To take the best out of this course, we recommened this:

* Register at [DataTalks.Club](https://DataTalks.Club) and join the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel 
* For each module, watch the videos and work through the code
* If you have any questions, ask them in the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel in Slack
* Do homework. There are solutions, but we advise to first attempt the homework yourself, and after that check the solutions
* Do at least one project. Two is better. Only this way you can make sure you're really learning. If you need feedback, use the `#course-ml-zoomcamp` channel

Of course, you can take each module independently.

### Prerequisites

* Prior programming experience (at least 1+ year)
* Being comfortable with command line 
* No prior exposure to machine learning is required

Nice to have but not mandatory

* Python (but you can learn it during the course)
* Prior exposure to linear algebra will be helpful (e.g. you studied it in college but forgot)

## Asking questions

The best way to get support is to use [DataTalks.Club's Slack](https://datatalks.club/slack.html). Join the [`#course-ml-zoomcamp`](https://app.slack.com/client/T01ATQK62F8/C0288NJ5XSA) channel.

To make discussions in Slack more organized:
